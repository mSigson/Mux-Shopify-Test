# Shopify Mux Test

## Description

Mux-Shopify-Test is Lazer's first step in exploring the Mux Video API and testing applications of it in Shopify online storefronts.

We want to build a fake store that uses Mux to broadcast livestreams similar to the old shopping channels where the presenter can highlight items from the storeâ€™s stock.

Our goal with this project is to eventually open source this project on Lazer's Github. We will also write a how-to guide on setting up a store like this and publish it on our website.
